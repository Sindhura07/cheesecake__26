                                  ___________STEP:1___________
Place 175g biscuits into a bowl or strong food bag and bash with a rolling pin or you can whizz them in a blender until finely crushed.
  Tip the crumbs into a bowl.  

                                    ___________STEP:2___________
  Place 25g vegan butter into a bowl and melt in a microwave,  then stir into the crushed biscuits until well mixed. 
   Press the crumbs into the base of the cake tin or spoon into glasses.  
   Chill while you make the filling (about 10 minutes).

(Use a flat-bottomed glass or measuring cup to even out the biscuit crumb if you seek even perfection in your biscuit base!)

                                 ___________STEP:3___________
Beat 600g of cream cheese with an electric hand whisk until smooth.
 Then mix in 100g of the Carnation vegan condensed milk alternative and 2tsp vanilla. 
 Spoon the mixture on top of the biscuit base, even out with the back of a spoon and chill for 2 hours or overnight.

                                 ___________STEP:4___________                       
 To make the caramel; put 170g Carnation vegan, 25g vegan butter, 3tbsp vegan milk or cream alternative, 3tbsp light soft brown sugar and a tiny pinch of salt into a non-stick pan, bring to a rapid boil and then bubble for 2-3 minutes.
   Allow to cool slightly so that you can taste it (be careful!) and add more salt to taste if it needs it.
     Drizzle the sauce over the cheesecake just before serving, letting it drip down the sides... mmm.:cupcake:,:cake:
